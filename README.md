### Building

Build with cmake (version 3.9.2 or later is required). Remember to fetch the submodules before compiling: `git submodule update --init`. A compiler compatible with C++17 is required.

**Optional Dependencies:** [Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL)](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl) for faster random variate generation, [libnuma](https://github.com/numactl/numactl) for Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) awareness, [GNU Scientific Library (GSL)](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) for their alias table implementation (only for comparison in the experiments).

### Experiments

To reproduce our experiments, compile using cmake and execute [benchmark/bench_all.sh](benchmark/bench_all.sh) from your build directory.
Note that this script targets a machine with 80 cores (160 threads).  A version for 32 cores (64 threads) is provided in [benchmark/bench_all_64.sh](benchmark/bench_all_64.sh).
Adjust this to your machine by changing the values to the `-t` parameter in `benchmark/run_*.sh`.
You might also want to change the output paths in `benchmark/run_*.sh`
